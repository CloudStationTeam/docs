# How to Use
(screenshot)
1. In your web browser, go to your AWS instance's DNS address. You should see ???
2. Sign up for an account. Use a password that you are not using for any other accounts.
3. After logging in, you will see a box that says "Connect to Vehicle via ID."
    * Make sure your drone or SITL instance is connected to one of your CloudStation instance's open UDP ports.
    * Enter the number of the UDP port your drone is connected to (e.g. 14550). This will be that vehicle's drone ID.
4. You can arm/disarm the drone or change its flight mode by clicking on the drone's icon on the map.
5. To set a fly-to point, make sure the tab of the drone you want to control is selected on the right-hand menu. Left-click anywhere on the map to drop a pin, then right click the pin to bring up the pop-up menu. From here, you can either "clear pin" or have the drone "fly-to" the pin.
